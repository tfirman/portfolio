      <h3>Hiking</h3>

      <h3>Fishing</h3>
      <p>Many of the streams and rivers in Yellowstone have many fish, as does Yellowstone Lake.  Permits are run by the Park, and you'll need to get one before you fish.  You'll only be able to fish for particular species, depending on the needs of the Park and on the permits.<p>
      <h3>Wildlife</h3>

      <P>There is a wide variety of wildlife throughout the Park, including bears, wolves, bison, elk, and many others.  The natural ecosystem is relatively pristine, as the land has been park for so long.  You'll likely see many different animals, though you should always be careful around larger animals!</p>
      <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
      <p>The area has a lot of geothermal activity, with hot rock and water coming up from beneath the land.  There are many interesting geological features, including the Yellowstone Canyon, hot springs, and many geysers.  Old Faithful is perhaps the most famous, erupting regularly for many years.</p>
